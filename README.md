# 🍁 Indigenous History-Makers

The first day of summer, June 21, marks **National Indigenous Peoples Day**, a day to recognize and celebrate First Nations people, Métis, and Inuit in Canada.
This project was built to help my kids learn more about Aboriginal cultures, and celebrate the greatness of Indigenous Heroes that they find on the internet.
